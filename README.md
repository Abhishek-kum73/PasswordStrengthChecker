# Password Strength Checker

The **Password Strength Checker** project is a Python-based tool that evaluates the strength of a password by checking various criteria, such as length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters), and overall complexity. This tool uses Python libraries to automate the evaluation and provide feedback on password strength.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Ensures the password meets the minimum length requirement.
- **Character Diversity**: Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Strength Evaluation**: Rates the password as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong" based on the checks.
- **Feedback**: Provides specific feedback to improve password strength.

## Getting Started

To use the **Password Strength Checker**, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed on your system (preferably Python 3.x).

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries by running the following command:
